# ECR repository policy allows access without enforcing specific conditions.
# The repository policy grants access only to explicitly defined principals
# (allowed_read_principals, allowed_write_principals) and the account root.
# Cross-account access is intentional and scoped per the policy design in policies.tf.

# ECR repository not using enhanced scanning (Amazon Inspector).
# Basic scanning (scan_on_push = true) is enabled by default.
# Set enable_enhanced_scanning = true for continuous Inspector-based scanning
# in production environments where Inspector is available.
